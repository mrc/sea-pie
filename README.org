* sea-pie
Tools for processing a text file.

* Examples
Read a word from a stream (possibly after swallowing non-word
characters):
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (with-open-file (f "alice.txt")
    (loop for i from 1 to 27
       collect (sea-pie:read-word f)))
  => ("CHAPTER" "I" "Down" "the" "Rabbit" "Hole" "Alice" "was" "beginning" "to" "get" "very" "tired" "of" "sitting" "by" "her" "sister" "on" "the" "bank" "and" "of" "having" "nothing" "to" "do")
#+END_SRC

Build a table of word frequencies (words as symbols, mapped to the
number of occurrences):
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (sea-pie:gather-word-frequencies-from-file "alice.txt")
  => #<HASH-TABLE :TEST EQL size 2854/3484 #x3020010316CD>
  => 27798
  (gethash 'rabbit *)
  => 46
#+END_SRC

By default the word frequency table has the words as uppercased
symbols. Regular strings can be used instead. Also note that the
result of ~gather-word-frequcies~ has a second value, which is a count
of the total number of words seen (which can be useful for developing
a probability model):

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (with-input-from-string (stream "This Is The Day This Is The Hour")
    (multiple-value-bind (freqs sum)
        (sea-pie:gather-word-frequencies stream :normalizer #'string-downcase :test 'equal)
      (loop for k being the hash-keys of freqs
         using (hash-value v)
         do (format t "~&~A = ~A~%" k v))
      (list freqs sum)))
  hour = 1
  is = 2
  the = 2
  this = 2
  day = 1
  => (#<HASH-TABLE :TEST EQUAL size 5/60 #x30200123094D> 8)
#+END_SRC

* Use
Add the project to your asdf search path (e.g. ~(push #P"../sea-pie/"
asdf:*central-registry*)~) then:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (ql:quickload :sea-pie)
#+END_SRC

* Test
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (t-sea-pie:test-all)
#+END_SRC
