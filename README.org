* sea-pie
Tools for processing a text file.

* Examples
Read a word from a stream (possibly after swallowing non-word characters):
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (with-open-file (f "alice.txt")
    (loop for i from 1 to 27
       collect (sea-pie:read-word f)))
  => ("CHAPTER" "I" "Down" "the" "Rabbit" "Hole" "Alice" "was" "beginning" "to" "get" "very" "tired" "of" "sitting" "by" "her" "sister" "on" "the" "bank" "and" "of" "having" "nothing" "to" "do")
#+END_SRC

Build a table of word frequencies (words as symbols, mapped to the number of occurrences):
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (sea-pie:gather-word-frequencies-from-file "alice.txt")
  => #<HASH-TABLE :TEST EQL size 2854/3484 #x3020010316CD>
  => 27798
  (gethash 'rabbit *)
  => 46
#+END_SRC

* Use
Add the path (e.g. ~(push #P"../sea-pie/" asdf:*central-registry*)~) then:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (ql:quickload :sea-pie)
#+END_SRC

** gather-word-frequencies

* Test
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (t-sea-pie:test-all)
#+END_SRC
